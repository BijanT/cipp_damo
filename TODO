- Test --numa_node 0 case
- Support profiling
  - Support rss recording and reporting wss/rss
  - Support flamegraph-wss-heatmap visualization
- Implement histogram stat regions output
- Deprecate old features
  - Deprecate translate_damos (done.)
  - Deprecate single line per-scheme (done.  code moved to _damon_deprecated)
  - Deprecate v1-v3 schemes (done.  necessary code moved to _damon_deprecated)
  - Deprecate python2 support (done.  code moved to _damon_deprecated)
  - Deprecate scheme subcommand
    - Can be replaced by start or tune
  - Deprecate old scheme usages in tests
  - Deprecate DAMON results record binary format (done.  code moved to
    _damon_deprecated)
- damo show features implementation
  - support target damos filter
  - time based filtering
  - collapse by time
  - collapse by priority value (more histogram control)
  - Implement min/max snapshot format keyword
- Test quota goals (might make more sense to test from in-tree DAMON tests)
- Handle quota goals tuning error / invalid inputs better
- damo reclaim: add a command for basic investigation
  - helps ensure DAMON_RECLAIM is working as expected
  - helps reporting issue
- Handle _damon_sysfs file i/o error for unsupported kernel features and
  conflicts with concurrent ones
- Optimize page management in 'replay'
  - Maybe we could manage it in 2 MiB granularity.
