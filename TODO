- Test --numa_node 0 case
- Implement histogram stat regions output
- damo show features implementation
  - support target damos filter
  - time based filtering
  - collapse by time
  - collapse by priority value (more histogram control)
    - --histogram hotness?
  - Implement min/max snapshot format keyword
- damo reclaim: add a command for basic investigation
  - helps ensure DAMON_RECLAIM is working as expected
  - helps reporting issue
- Handle _damon_sysfs file i/o error for unsupported kernel features and
  conflicts with concurrent ones
- Optimize 'replay' performance
  - An approach for 2 MiB-granularity page management didn't show improvement
  - Optionally use C program like 'masim'
- damo record: Let recording without access pattern
- Let 'replay' further parse vmas and alloc/release memory
- Implement yet another report type for holistic view
  - Show heatmap, footprint, wss, profile at glance
  - For profile, curses-based TUI might needed
- Unify wss and footprints report types
- Fixup 'damo show' on schemes_tried_regions unsupported kernels
  - Either make the warning clear, or support it using trace points
  - (https://github.com/awslabs/damo/issues/101)
- Implement 'diagnose' command
  - Check if anything suspicious, including
    - nr_regions out of {min,max}_nr_regions
    - DAMOS out of access_pattern/quota/watermarks control
- Advance monitoring command
  - Provide realtime holistic dashboard, like 'top'
    - shows heatmap, footprints, hot functions, for last N seconds
      - add option to add snapshot as (optional) alternate of heatmap

- Deprecate old features
  - Deprecate heats report type in favor of heatmap report type
  - Deprecate translate_damos (done.)
  - Deprecate single line per-scheme (done.  code moved to _damon_deprecated)
  - Deprecate v1-v3 schemes (done.  necessary code moved to _damon_deprecated)
  - Deprecate python2 support (done.  code moved to _damon_deprecated)
  - Deprecate scheme subcommand
    - Can be replaced by start or tune
  - Deprecate old scheme usages in tests
  - Deprecate DAMON results record binary format (done.  code moved to
    _damon_deprecated)
