- Get sysfs/debugfs mount point from /proc/mounts file
- Re-write sysfs/debugfs without features detection

Current sysfs/debugfs constructs every file i/o at once and submit it to
_damo_fs.  Since the whole set of i/o operations should success, those require
features detection, which makes damo stateful.  Rewrite it to do i/o one by one
and handle unsupported features on the fly.
