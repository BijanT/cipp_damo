- Test --numa_node 0 case
- Implement histogram stat regions output
- damo show features implementation
  - support target damos filter
  - time based filtering
  - collapse by time
  - collapse by priority value (more histogram control)
    - --histogram hotness?
  - Implement min/max snapshot format keyword
- damo reclaim: add a command for basic investigation
  - helps ensure DAMON_RECLAIM is working as expected
  - helps reporting issue
- Handle _damon_sysfs file i/o error for unsupported kernel features and
  conflicts with concurrent ones
- Optimize 'replay' performance
  - An approach for 2 MiB-granularity page management didn't show improvement
  - Optionally use C program like 'masim'
- Let 'replay' further parse vmas and alloc/release memory
- Unify wss and footprints report types
- Fixup 'damo show' on schemes_tried_regions unsupported kernels
  - Either make the warning clear, or support it using trace points
  - (https://github.com/awslabs/damo/issues/101)
- 'diagnose' command
  - check if nr_regions in bound
  - check if DAMOS quota is in control
- 'damo monitor'
  - add option to add snapshot as (optional) alternate of heatmap
- Show temperature histogram on holistic report
- status: Show kdamond cpu usage
- heatmap: Support interactive zoom in/out/scrolling
- implement new workflow commands
  - args: Format complext command arguments like DAMON parameters in json and
    snapshot formatter
  - collect: Collect DAMON status/output and System status
  - read: Visualize collected data
  - Maybe we could extend record/report, deprecate show and some options.
    - extend record for snapshot capturing (done: --snapshot)
      - damo record --shots <count> <delay>
        - if <delay> is zero, the conventional record.
          - simply do conventional record if --snapshot is not given.
    - extend report for snapshot showing
      - damo report accesses --filter <filter> --format <format>
      - extend 'damo args' for <filter> and <format>
    - deprecate monitor
      1. extend report for recording together
      2. extend report for repeating multiple times
      3. finally deprecate monitor
- deprecate DAMON parameters options
  - Done by simply suppressing the help message
- Provide virtual memory mapping information
  - shows when what virtual address has mappend and unmapped

- Deprecate old features
  - Deprecate fmt_json in favor of 'args damon'
    - wait inputs for 'args damon' for 1 week
    - mark 'args damon' non-experimental
    - mark 'fmt_json' as will-be-deprecated, wait inputs for one month
    - fully deprecate 'fmt_json', wait inputs for one quota
    - remove 'fmt_json'
  - Deprecate heats report type in favor of heatmap report type
  - Deprecate translate_damos (done.)
  - Deprecate single line per-scheme (done.  code moved to _damon_deprecated)
  - Deprecate v1-v3 schemes (done.  necessary code moved to _damon_deprecated)
  - Deprecate python2 support (done.  code moved to _damon_deprecated)
  - Deprecate scheme subcommand
    - Can be replaced by start or tune
  - Deprecate old scheme usages in tests
  - Deprecate DAMON results record binary format (done.  code moved to
    _damon_deprecated)
