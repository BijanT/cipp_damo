General Process
===============

For contributions, please refer to the linux kernel development process[1] and
send patches to sj@kernel.org or pull-requests via Github.  The contributions
should have proper 'Signed-off-by:' tags[2].  The tag will be considered the
same as that of the linux kernel development process.

There are two branches, 'master' and 'next'.  Changes first merged in 'next',
get tested, and finally merged in 'master', if the tests show no problem.  So,
please base your work on 'next'.

What To Do, First?
==================

Testing First
-------------

If you want to participate in the development but are unsure what to do first,
you could consider running DAMO tests on your system.  It might reveal some
issues in DAMO.  You could also contribute more tests.  You can run the tests
via below command from the root of DAMO.

    $ sudo ./tests/run.sh

If you want to run wider range of tests, or have interests in not only DAMO but
also DAMON, you could also run DAMON tests suite
(https://github.com/damonitor/damon-tests) on your system.  It might reveal some
issues in DAMO or DAMON.

TODO list
---------

There is a list of todo items for DAMO in 'TODO' file of this repo.  If
you don't have specific task to do at the moment, you could consider finding
one from the file.  The list is not well managed at the moment, and the items
may not well explained.  Please feel free to reach out to the original author
of the item for asking details.


Source Files Organiazation
==========================

Source files of the repository is organized in directories as below.

The root of this repository is a place for documents and the executable file,
`damo`.  Users can use `damo` via the executable file.  It is just a symbolic
link to real executable, `src/damon.py`.

`src` directory is for real source files of `damo`.

`tests` directory is for tests of `damo`.  As mentioned on `Testing First`
section above, you can run the tests by running `tests/run.sh` file with `sudo`
permission.  Some tests that not required to run DAMON doesn't really need
`sudo` though.

`packaging` directory contains files for easier PyPI
(https://pypi.org/project/damo/) packaging.  It could contain files for other
packaging systems in future.  If you package `damo` for other packaging systems
and you have your own files for that out of `damo` tree, please feel free to
send PR for maintaining that in the tree, if you prefer to.

`images` directory is for image files that linked on documents.
