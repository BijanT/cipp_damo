General Process
===============

For contributions, please refer to the linux kernel development process[1] and
send patches to sj@kernel.org or pull-requests via Github.  The contributions
should have proper 'Signed-off-by:' tags[2].  The tag will be considered the
same as that of the linux kernel development process.

There are two branches, 'master' and 'next'.  Changes first merged in 'next',
get tested, and finally merged in 'master', if the tests show no problem.  So,
please base your work on 'next'.

What To Do, First?
==================

Testing First
-------------

If you want to participate in the development but are unsure what to do first,
you could consider running DAMON tests suite
(https://github.com/awslabs/damon-tests) on your system.  It might reveal some
issues in DAMO or DAMON to you.

If you have more interest in development of DAMO itself than DAMON, you could
consider running only DAMO tests on your system.  You can run the tests via
below command from the root of DAMO.

    $ sudo ./tests/run.sh

It might reveal some issues in DAMO to you.

TODO list
---------

You can find TODO list at 'TODO' file.  You could find some tasks from the
list.  The list is not well managed, though.
