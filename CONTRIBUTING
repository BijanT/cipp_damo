General Process
===============

For contributions, please refer to the linux kernel development process[1] and
send patches to sjpark@amazon.com or pull-requests via Github.  The
contributions should have proper 'Signed-off-by:' tags[2].  The tag will be
considered the same as that of the linux kernel development process.

There are two branches, 'master' and 'next'.  Changes first merged in 'next',
get tested, and finally merged in 'master', if the tests show no problem.  So,
please base your work on 'next'.

What To Do, First?
==================

If you want to participate in the development but are unsure what to do first,
you could consider running DAMON tests suite
(https://github.com/awslabs/damon-tests) on your system.  It might reveal some
issues in DAMO or DAMON to you.
